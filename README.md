# twtbot
These set of bots each do a specific task.
bot.py retweets,likes and replies to a tweet if the bot's username is mentioned
searchBot.py takes specific hashtags of your choice and retweets a number of tweets containing one of those hashtags.
FollowBot.py follows the users who follow you
All these bots are then deployed into a web server which can run them 24/7. In our case we used pythonanywhere.com as a server
